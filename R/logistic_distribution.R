#' @title Logistic Distribution Functions
#' @name logistic_distribution
#' @description Functions to compute the probability density function, cumulative distribution function, and quantile function for the Logistic distribution.
#' @param x quantile
#' @param location location parameter (default is 0)
#' @param scale scale parameter (default is 1)
#' @param p probability (0 <= p <= 1)
#' @return A single numeric value with the computed probability density, log-probability density, cumulative distribution, log-cumulative distribution, or quantile depending on the function called.
#' @seealso [Boost Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/math/doc/html/math_toolkit/dist_ref/dists/logistic_dist.html) for more details on the mathematical background.
